# Current Continuity — Product Rebuild (Post-Reset)

**This is the concise current history.** The complete original 33k-character Qt Widgets chronology has been preserved at [pre-reset continuity archive](archive/CONTINUITY_QT_WIDGETS_PRE_RESET_2026-10-29.md). Do not prepend repeated CI result paragraphs here.

## 29 October 2026 — Owner-driven full product reset

- Owner inspected native Qt Widgets build and **rejected its entire aesthetic direction**. Cosmetic patches to current graphite/lime visuals are not an acceptable completion plan.
- Owner expressly allowed a full teardown/rebuild of code, application architecture, layouts, toolkits and structures as long as the resulting product retains verified behaviour and runs in a usable local development environment.
- Agreed product direction: **light-first, welcoming, neat and premium; no dark system**. Three primary areas **Overview, Fleet, Rentals**. Fleet **gallery-first with real functional table alternate**. Cohesive high-fidelity multi-screen design and contextual vehicle drawers, guided quote/review rental workflow, subtle purposeful interactions.
- Qt Quick/QML plus typed C++ adapter is **candidate**, not a confirmed architecture until real Windows Qt Creator feasibility proof. Existing Qt Widgets/flat-file implementation remains a recoverable functional reference, with valid old CI evidence but rejected visual screenshots.
- Replaced stale deadline/Qt-polish roadmap with [new gated plan](ROADMAP.md); [master audit](PRODUCT_REBUILD_MASTER_AUDIT_2026-10-29.md), [experience spec](../design/DESIGN_SPEC.md), [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [testing](TESTING.md), [Windows acceptance](WINDOWS_ACCEPTANCE.md) now distinguish future from completed.
- Archived **exact old documents** in [docs/archive](archive/README.md) and old design specs in design/archive, preserving audit/CI traceability without presenting them as current.
- Documentation changes isolated on non-PR branch **docs/product-rebuild-reset-20261029** to avoid additional CI minutes; **PR #4 remains draft/unmerged**, **main unchanged**. No new UI code, DB migration or live Windows acceptance has been performed by this reset.

## Parallel strategy context

Owner reported GitHub Actions usage limit with expected 1 November 2026 reset. Public repo normally receives free standard hosted runners, so actual restriction requires a clear notification check. A **separate** [docs/ci-budget-development-strategy-20261029 branch](https://github.com/Sonkhe-Shongwe/vehicle-rental-system/tree/docs/ci-budget-development-strategy-20261029) holds preparatory CI improvements and a local Windows test helper, unmerged and not yet runtime verified.

## Next decision

Approve or revise a coherent high-fidelity design review set (Overview + Fleet Gallery/Table/Drawer + Rentals/Active/Return/History, two target sizes, accessible and stateful). Then perform **Windows Qt Quick feasibility**, not a blind total rewrite. Technical sign-off and owner visual acceptance are explicit future gates.
